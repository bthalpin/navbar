# Navbar

## Description
Navbar is a reusable Navigation bar component for use in React projects.  It provides you with simple and clean navigation, as well as a drop down menu for mobile devices.

I've added a TypeScript version of the navbar in the NavbarTS folder.

## Usage
To use, copy the Navbar folder into your React project src folder (I typically place it in /src/components) and import it into the part of the project you want to have a navbar.
